            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Definition:</strong> Ionization enthalpy is the amount of energy required to remove an electron from an isolated gaseous atom in its ground state.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Trends in the Periodic Table:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Across a Period:</strong> Ionization enthalpy increases from left to right across a period. This is because the nuclear charge increases, which attracts the electrons more strongly, making it harder to remove an electron.</li>
                <li><strong>Down a Group:</strong> Ionization enthalpy decreases down a group. This is due to the increase in atomic size and the shielding effect, which makes it easier to remove an outer electron.</li>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Metallic Character</h2>
            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Definition:</strong> Metallic character refers to the set of properties associated with metals, including the ability to conduct electricity, malleability, ductility, and the tendency to lose electrons and form positive ions.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Trends in the Periodic Table:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Across a Period:</strong> Metallic character decreases from left to right across a period. As you move from metals to non-metals, the tendency to lose electrons decreases.</li>
                <li><strong>Down a Group:</strong> Metallic character increases down a group. The outer electrons are further from the nucleus and are more easily lost, making the elements more metallic.</li>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Electron Gain Enthalpy (Electron Affinity)</h2>
            <p class="mb-2"><strong>Definition:</strong> Electron gain enthalpy is the amount of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom in the gaseous state to form a negative ion.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Trends in the Periodic Table:</h3>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li><strong>Across a Period:</strong> Electron gain enthalpy generally becomes more negative (more energy is released) from left to right across a period, especially for non-metals, as they have a greater tendency to gain electrons.</li>
                <li><strong>Down a Group:</strong> Electron gain enthalpy becomes less negative (less energy is released) down a group. This is because the added electron is further from the nucleus and experiences more shielding, making it less stable.</li>
